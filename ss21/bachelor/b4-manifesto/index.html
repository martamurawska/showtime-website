                Manifesto is an interactive sound and video installation created in collaboration with Marc Sinan Company. 
            </p>
        
        <p>Manifesto is an interactive installation that is designed and developed in a way that the <strong>camera-enabled motion sensors</strong> act as the starting point of a complex pipeline consisting of multiple interfaces. The activity of the event visitors is monitored, analyzed and subsequently translated into sounds produced by an organ. The project is to be presented and executed simultaneously in multiple locations statewide and is dedicated to the victims of the National Socialist Underground murders. The main event is to take place in the St Martin&rsquo;s Church in Kassel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kulturstiftung-des-bundes.de/en/programmes_projects/theatre_and_movement/detail/no_closure.html">Manifesto is a part of “No closure!”, a nationwide theatre project on the National Socialist Underground funded by the German Federal Cultural Foundation</a></p>

    <h3>
        
            Requirements
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The first decision we had to make as a team was the decision if we were going to oversee the project till the <strong>Showtime event (July 16th, 2021)</strong> or till the actual event in November. The latter would have given us two whole months for the concept development, right in time for the Showtime event. After Showtime we would have had two more months for the technical realization of the concept developed by the team. Due to schedule clashes most of the team members had over the months of August and September, the team decided to present the whole project at the Showtime event. That means that we were to develop the whole project, including the concept, the technical requirements, the realization, and its reassemble capabilities, with the Showtime date as the deadline, and present it there in the form of a video presentation. The project is to be handed over to Marc Sinan Company for further management.</p>
<p>The main idea behind the project is that the floor area is an interactive field for the event visitors. As mentioned above, the project is a part of <strong>“No closure!”, a nationwide theatre project on the National Socialist Underground Terror.</strong> Manifesto is to be thought-provoking for its visitors. The concept that we elaborate on later on here had as its main requirement the idea of finding a way to use floor area in such a way that it makes the event visitors think and promotes the feelings of <strong>closeness and togetherness</strong> in them.</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong>Growing and learning together</strong> Establishing a clear and transparent structure within the team, fixed meeting appointments and a set of helpful project management tools to use helped to bring the team work in motion.</li>
<li>Although hard at first, eventually we managed to pinpoint the strong suits and interests of each team member and find a way to take advantage of those in the project. <strong>This way we reached a productive workflow.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Elyess</strong> was the first to jump onto development of the technical interfaces and got help from <strong>Stepan</strong> and <strong>Dennis</strong> later on. The concept development was taken over by Nils who got help from <strong>Martin</strong>. The concept went through several phases and to be finally presented to Marc Sinan Company by <strong>Nils</strong>. Further possible developments of the project were discussed as well. All in all, more than 50 various tasks were allocated and completed. We made sure that everyone knew who was taking care of what at each given moment. The results were presented to the team 2-3 times a week. At the end of each meeting we discussed further steps and assigned new tasks in the project management board.</li>
