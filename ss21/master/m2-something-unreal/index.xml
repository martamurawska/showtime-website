      <description>Main Menu Main Menu We have built a simple main menu into our game. Here, the player has an overview of the controls and can start the game. The main menu offers good expansion possibility to add more levels later on.
Objectives The objectives of the game can also be seen in the main menu.
The Level Player travels through an artery Virus turns green when reachable to get hit In the level design, we focused on making the artery look as realistic as possible.</description>

      <description>First things first general ideas collected Every project has a beginning and an end. Before we started doing anything, we were discussing possible ideas for a project. We had to do something with Unreal Engine 4, but the question was, what do we want to do? And how do we want to do it? Who wants to do what? In the beginning we had a lot of questions and we tried to hold all our ideas in a Miro board.</description>

      <description>Development Unreal Engine 4
Unreal Engine 4 was our main tool.
We built our project and put all small parts together as one. Oculus
We developed and tested our game with the Oculus Quest, we also used Oculus Link to link the Quest to the PC. SteamVR
We were able to play Something Unreal on the Quest via an Unreal plugin using SteamVR. Hardware Oculus Quest
Three of us used the VR-Headset from Oculus, the Oculus Quest 1.</description>

      <description> Many ideas, too little time We had many ideas for the creation of new levels and features for Something Unreal. Unfortunately, we were only able to put a very small number of these ideas into practice in the short time available. Extension possibilities of Something Unreal Unlimited number of further levels e.g. a space level or city level Inclusion of a level editor so that the players themselves can determine the music in the levels Expansion with boss fights </description>

      <description>The Team We are a team of various personalities, ages, experience and knowledge. We all came together to work on the project Something Unreal. Despite diversity, there is one thing that unites us all - our love for video games and new technologies.
In the beginning, everyone shared their preferences on what they would like to contribute to the project. Some wanted to gain new experiences, while others wanted to do what they are good at.</description>
