    <h3>
        
            Tech Stack
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4 id="djangopython">Django/Python</h4>
<p>When choosing the backend, we had decided to use <strong>Python</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Django</strong>. We had the choice to use NodeJS instead, but the final choice was Python in combination with Django. Django offers on the one hand the possibility to set up a <strong>SQLIte DB</strong> without downloading additional dependencies and on the other hand a fully <strong>integrated user-role management system</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>Django</strong> is an excellent tool to implement <strong>prototypical approaches</strong>. Because the project focus was on research, we were tempted to use utilities that would take some of the work off our hands. Django offers many templates due to the many plugins, which supported us in our development flow.<br>
Another reason was that we wanted to create <strong>synergies</strong> and not burden our tech stack unnecessarily. Since Python is predominantly used in state of the art machine learning models, it was logical for us to also embed Python as a backend. Even though we finally decided for a knowledge based system, Python was the best choice.</p>
<h4 id="reacttypescript">React/Typescript</h4>
<p>We chose React for the frontend because it is very <strong>lightweight</strong> and allows controlled dom updates. Furthermore, it is very beginner-friendly compared to other frameworks such as Angular. The <strong>component-based design</strong> contributes to a clear structure. In addition, it is becoming apparent that React is <strong>gaining popularity</strong> in the international arena. In combination with Typescript, we had a very pleasant developer experience. Typescript helps to type variables and classes which allows you to detect errors faster and write <strong>consistent and clean code</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="threejsreact-three-fiber">ThreeJS/react-three-fiber</h4>
<p>We wanted to visualise playful elements in our app. There were quite a few libraries to choose from, but Three.js and Babylon.js made it to the final shortlist. Based on an article (<a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/webgl-frameworks-three-js-vs-babylon-js-36975d915694"><a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/webgl-frameworks-three-js-vs-babylon-js-36975d915694">https://javascript.plainenglish.io/webgl-frameworks-three-js-vs-babylon-js-36975d915694</a></a>) comparing both technologies, we finally decided to use three.js. <strong>Why three.js?</strong> It has a <strong>well written documentation</strong> with <strong>lots of examples</strong> to play with, <strong>detailed tutorials</strong> and an <strong>active community</strong>. In combination with ReactJS, we used react-three-fiber, which is an react renderer. With the help of react-three-fiber, we can build our scenes declaratively with <strong>re-usable, self-contained components</strong> that react to state, are readily interactive and can tap into React&rsquo;s ecosystem.
We also used <strong>Cinema4D</strong>, an 3D animation, modelling, simulation and rendering software to create our 3D models.</p>

            Development Tools
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4 id="gitlabgit">Gitlab/Git</h4>
<p>We chose Gitlab because we didn&rsquo;t want to focus on just deploying code, but wanted to associate tasks directly with individual sprint tickets. Gitlab has built-in functionality that allows a user to create boards. This allowed us to have a more <strong>streamlined scrum workflow</strong>. It is also possible to assign a ticket to specific branches or commits. Furthermore, our communication and code reviews also took place through the platform.</p>
<h4 id="miro">Miro</h4>
<p>Miro has been a good tool in many ways:
We&rsquo;ve been able to brainstorm on the platform, discuss different ideas, and generally encourage more <strong>creative interaction</strong>. In addition, we were able to <strong>conceptualize</strong> our ideas <strong>prototypically</strong>, always had an up-to-date overview of the project&rsquo;s progress, and thus were able to react dynamically to problems. This approach is very similar to agile methods.</p>
<h4 id="discordzoom">Discord/Zoom</h4>
<p>Discord offers through its channel system a <strong>good structure</strong> to react quickly and targeted to issues. In terms of communication, it offers advantages in that each participant can provide his or her screen, which is unfortunately not the case with other software solutions. This feature alone helps immensely when debugging together and <strong>increases our awareness</strong> of cooperative work.</p>
