      <description>The Process Our work was structured in a variance of Scrum. We met twice a week. On Mondays, we met online and presented the current state of our work to each other. It was also necessary for discussing our ideas and suggestions of functionalities or designs. Thursdays we met with our supervisor in the Diva-E office at Berlin SÃ¼dkreuz to present our achievements, review the past week, discuss problems and plan the next weekly sprint.</description>
