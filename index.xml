      <description>Challenges Designing an appropriate mental health concept Creating a suitable concept for a mental health chatbot application comes with its unique set of challenges, primarily due to the sensitive nature of the topic that demands utmost care and empathy. Mental health is a deeply personal and delicate issue, making it crucial to approach the design process with great sensitivity and respect for the users&amp;rsquo; emotional well-being. Therefore the planning and design process required multiple cycles of refinement and validation involving psychology expert views and much in-depth research.</description>

      <description>Concept The Marc Sinan Company shared the main idea with us: how the inner room of a church should be turned into an interactive area where one has to work together with the others; the event should act as a memorial to the victims of the National Socialist Underground murders.
The concept is the project foundation and was developed in collaboration and coordination with the Marc Sinan Company. An important point here was dividing the whole act into substeps to define the possible states of it.</description>

      <description>Chatbot: A chatbot, the heart of our software, should offer the user a pleasant and intuitive solution to deal with the cyber security of his system, using natural language only. The artificial intelligence classifies the user input and reacts accordingly. It also recognizes previous results and can base new audits on them. An active scan can always be monitored by the user through logs. Results can be viewed permanently at any time.</description>

      <description>📕 Embeddings Embedding of user-supplied information: As the knowledge of OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s models is limited with a cutoff date in time and lack of really specific information, more recent or specialized information is unavailable to the AI. To counter this, we are using embeddings to inject our information into the AI prompts. Hereby, chunks of information, like paragraphs, are transformed into a vector space. These vectors capture semantic relationships and patterns to be able to classify their textual content.</description>

      <description>Features To monitor heart rate, which is a measure of stress, we have integrated a Bluetooth interface into the framework. A paired heart rate device passes on its measured data to VamX. The course of the heart rate is displayed as a graph in the framework in real time.
VamX and heart rate measuring instrument are connected via bluetooth. For testing the framework we have developed three VR games. Based on their different characteristics, various predictions and scenarios are to be drawn for one&amp;rsquo;s own application.</description>

      <description>The artificial intelligence engine Our goal is to develop an expert system capable of guessing professions by asking the user a series of questions. This concept is inspired by the Akinator application. By traversing a dynamic tree the software automatically selects a series of questions and it also calculates the score of the user and determines his job, that will allow the artificial intelligence engine to guess as quickly as possible the most suitable professions for the user and determines the technical skills that the user has or not depending on the answers to the questions and gives an assessment.</description>

      <description>The Old IMI-Map The goal of this project was to rewrite the IMI-Map using a new Tech Stack. So we rewrote the app implementing all the features of the old IMI-Map:
Internship Search
Students can search the internship database of the IMI-Map to get inspiration for their own internship. Internship Postponements
Students can request a postponement of their internship using the IMI-Map. These requests can then be processed and accepted or denied by the internship officer using the IMI-Map as well.</description>

What&amp;#39;s new? While preparing for the showtime we remembered the quote above from the devs at Firaxis, called Sid Meier&amp;rsquo;s 33/33/33 rule of sequel design. Although we didn&amp;rsquo;t stick to it 100%, we think it provides a great way for us to comprehensively break down which parts of our application changed since our previous version.</description>

      <description>Introduction Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy a round of &amp;ldquo;Battleship&amp;rdquo;? Inspired by this classic game, we came up with the idea of &amp;ldquo;shooting&amp;rdquo; asteroids and alien spaceships. The coordinate system on which &amp;ldquo;Battleship&amp;rdquo; is also played offers the perfect opportunity to work with complex numbers and make an entertaining but also educational game out of it. Since mathematics and guessing coordinates, even if done strategically, don&amp;rsquo;t really go together, we made some modifications.</description>

Due to the limited time we had to set aside many ideas and compromise on several aspects of the final game design. Keeping that in mind, we made sure to design all aspects of our game intuitively so that the software remains easily extensible. Additionally, we created a documentation of all the tools, assets and further preparations that are needed to get this project up and running.</description>

      <description>Feature set Offline Data Our app is completely offline compatible We have over 30.000 ingredients stored in our data set. It was important for us to guarantee that the user is always able to use the app. Therefore we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on an internet connection.
Text Recognition/Filtering Our app uses the Firebase ML text recognition to recognise the ingredients on the back of the product.
The backside of a product is full of information that isn&amp;rsquo;t interesting to us or our app.</description>

      <description>Feedback The main purpose of our application is to get good and constructive feedback to enhance meetings in an agile work environment. A look at the questionnaire Fast and easy To get people to respond on a daily basis this process has to be quick and easy. Therefore we focussed on getting the best possible assessments with only a few clicks. Automation Since our app is connected to the Outlook API, the invitation links for the questionnaires get sent out automatically 5 minutes after the meeting to the meeting attendees.</description>

      <description>User roles In our application we have two roles: recruiter and job seeker. The recruiter can create job offers and job seekers can fill out their resume. Simple sign up The user fills out a questionnaire where they answer questions about the job or employee they are looking for. A job seeker answers questions about their own skills, expectations and values. A recruiter fills out their expectations on a job seeker and information about what their company offers.</description>

Create Your Own Projects After first opening the app, users are able to create as many individual projects as they please, to save their photographs and 3D-models in an organized way. Create Your Own Projects Take Photos With The Built In Camera In order to create a 3D-model of their head, users must be able to include photos they have taken in their projects.</description>

      <description>Customizable UI Having built our own customized theme, the site not only meets all the requirements from the business owner but also make it extremely easy to maintain. Through templates and adding php code to each and every UI element on the site, non-programmer admins log in then use customizer to edit image, text, style, layout, hyperlink, adjust navigation, change site info and so on. This of course prolong the frontend development process, but in the long run, it&amp;rsquo;ll save the start-up resources to modify even something as small as a punctuation, and since UI maintaining becomes as easy as it gets, business owners could easily change content up on the Live site without the users seeing any of the changes before publishing them.</description>

      <description>Athletimize facilitates training planning and management by including holistic data. It provides the following features to athletic teams and organizations:
Assessments We have two types of assessments:
Daily assessments are answered everyday in the morning. The questions range from the athlete&amp;rsquo;s state of mind to their body condition Session assessments are answered right after a training or match has taken place. The athletes give their personal view about the intensity of the session and provide the time that they were involved.</description>

      <description>The majority of our time was spent on coming up with new concepts and developing prototypes to test them. Most of our “features” are behind the scenes in our scripts, our model parameters and the general setup. Each machine learning project is different and there are no well known solutions that “just work” for every application. What we present here is only a high level impression of our work, where we summarize the current state and give some details on the prediction quality of our models.</description>

      <description>Training-Related Task To provide an ingame objective which represents an everyday work task to the trainees, their instructors were included in the development process.
When entering the virtual workshop the players receive the task to craft a dice. This requires interaction with cutting machines like the hand lever or the guillotine shears as well as the bench drill to perforate the metal workpieces. To set the final product together, a glue gun needs to be used.</description>

Part of every allmende profile is also one of many status icons, which have to be unlocked through challenges, to see if a user is a Tree-Hugger, a Mushroom-Head or something different.</description>

      <description>Elective course registration Ranking System (by HTW) The ranking system provided by the HTW is still the most important set of rules that we had to follow and we could not change it for the course distribution. Although the ranking system might sound fair at first, the students from the higher ranks have the opportunity to receive courses without restriction. This could lead to people getting courses they only wanted as an insurance for the case that they do not get a different course, while other people do not get to attend it, even though it might have been the course they wanted the most.</description>

      <description>The Game After a shipwreck you find yourself stranded on a small tropical island. Luckily, the island isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely deserted as you find a local inhabitant willing to help you. They would like to bring you to the main island, as there is a ship which might bring you home. But without any money, paying for the fare won&amp;rsquo;t be possible. Luckily though, the Captain offered you a free ride in return for some help around the island.</description>

New records can be added either in the calendar or graph view, using the plus-button. Records can be edited afterwards using the pen-button.
In the tracker view, users can estimate how strong a symbol is, from a scale from 0 (no symptom) to 5.</description>

The following describes our prototypical implementation with a few select data sources to showcase the features and possibilities of those systems.</description>

      <description>Features Since the game no longer relies on physical cards and actually closing your eyes or f.e. laying your head onto your arms, we’re able to elude unnecessary complications. Despite that virtualization, the game is mainly determined by the verbal communication between the players on “game days”. The rule structure can be quite complex depending on the player&amp;rsquo;s experience and the choice of rules and roles, thus slowing down the dynamics of the player group.</description>

      <description>Features There are two parts of the template:
the infrastructure part (tells what resources to deploy to AWS) the business logic part (the code itself that runs in the Lambda) The AWS setup is generic: the API Gateway receives traffic (we get some data about favorite colors, snacks and movies with different data types in JSON format) and then it is passed to the Lambda function. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the incoming data is valid or not, it will be saved to the S3 bucket, but if the validation does succeed, it will also be sent to the SQS Queue from where it can be used for various internal idealo needs.</description>

We had many ideas in mind, from designing little telepresence games like &amp;ldquo;Who Am I?&amp;rdquo;, a flexible poll tool up to an online-tutoring platform for students.
Our brainstorming process As interesting as all of those ideas would have been, the spark has not yet jumped. We had to do another round and really ask ourselves – and our supervisor Barne – what it really is that we want to achieve.</description>

      <description>Process To start with, we first had to define what a mini-game looks like. As we were able to determine, it was not so easy to commit to the necessary functions. We decided to look at the mini-games as a whole and to view our &amp;ldquo;mini-games&amp;rdquo; as individual tasks of a gaming experience. By implementing simple functions such as pressing a button or moving the control stick in one direction, every gamer&amp;rsquo;s heart is addressed.</description>

There were multiple different ideas like a chat assistant and including the OpenAI speech recognition Whisper. Finally we decided on 3 use cases to explore: curated shopping list, product comparison and a product summary.
The first week was focused on onboarding, reading OpenAI documentation and prompt engineering to test feasibility of our selected use cases.</description>

      <description>Process Our journey began with a crucial kickoff meeting, where we discussed the project&amp;rsquo;s milestones and set the schedules for their completion. During this meeting, the team collaborated to find suitable meeting days and times that would accommodate everyone&amp;rsquo;s busy schedules. In our subsequent meetings, we focused on comprehensive progress updates. We discussed the tasks we had been diligently working on and candidly addressed any challenges we encountered along the way.</description>

      <description>Organization The project management was mainly done via GitLab, with the GitLab server provided by our project supervisors David Koschnick and Christoph Bork. We followed agile methods and focused primarily on scrum-like project management. However, due to the small team size, we made some deviations from a pure scrum approach.
At the beginning of the project we brought together our individual skills and interests and developed a shared vision for the product.</description>

      <description>Process Research The research process was crucial for the project due to its focus on the sensitive topic of mental illnesses. Extensive research was required for mental illnesses in general, looking into various psychological models and medical literature to make important decisions about choosing appropriate features for a fitting target group. Therefore a thorough examination of the targeted users were also overly crucial including a careful analysis of the mental illness - depression.</description>

      <description>Process Trello board In our project, we managed the process using a Trello board, a helpful tool for organizing tasks and responsibilities. The Kanban board allowed us to efficiently distribute tasks among the team members and track the progress of each assignment. This method facilitated clear communication and coordination throughout the project, ensuring that everyone knew their roles and deadlines. We also held meeting sessions every Monday via Microsoft Teams.</description>

      <description>Research As the very first step of our research, we read multiple studies and articles on the topic obesity and its reduction or prevention in adults as well as in children in order to understand the physiological, psychologial and environmental factors influencing the success or failure of attempted weight loss reduction or weight gain prevention. We summarised our research results on a Miro Board where we collected all our future ideas from there.</description>

      <description>Research Since Spotify – with a whole team of experts behind it – is one of the global players in audio streaming, the question was how the team of seven students could improve the product in a short time. In the beginning, research had to be carried out in various directions in order to be able to identify possible optimisations and restructurings.
Basic questions like the target group and main focus points of our project had to be answered.</description>

      <description>Process At the beginning of the project, there was a brainstorming phase where we as a group wanted to define which games could be considered for an app. We had ideas like: Scotland Yard as a board game, children&amp;rsquo;s games like hide and seek, Werewolf, Settlers of Catan as a board game with landscape cards and figures, Pen &amp;amp; Paper, a mix-up: an app that includes a set of cards and dice almost like a Swiss knife for party games and some more.</description>

      <description>Process The initial idea was to build a payload modification processing based on the CDK template, which would then go into production and could prove to be a cheaper solution than the server solution currently used at idealo. The Lambda function should have done some payload verification and possibly signature verification (related to cryptography).
There were some reasons why it did not happen:
idealo decided to discontinue the Direktkauf feature, the scope was changed, so it was not really applicable anymore.</description>

      <description>Requirements Analysis The requirements analysis phase of the project was critical in ensuring the successful delivery of a solution that met the needs of both professors and students. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive approach was taken to gather and evaluate all relevant requirements.
The process started with a brainstorming session where all potential requirements were documented. This information was then reviewed and prioritized, focusing on the most important features for both target groups.</description>

      <description>💻 Development The project was built upon an existing prototype, reducing the need for starting from scratch. Flutter, a Google-developed open-source framework for cross-platform app development, was chosen for the UI. It utilizes Dart, a programming language tightly integrated with Flutter. The Isar database is a robust Flutter package that seamlessly integrates databases. It offers fast performance, supports various data types, and facilitates efficient data filtering. Additionally, it optimizes offline usage and benefits from a strong community support, making it a reliable data management solution for Flutter applications.</description>

Aufgrund der besonderen Schwierigkeiten dieses Semesters, konnten wir uns auch nicht persönlich treffen und uns so kennenlernen. Zusätzlich hatte die Hälfte von uns noch nie mit Unity, der Entwicklungsumgebung, mit der wir unser Spiel erstellen wollten, gearbeitet. Doch rückblickend müssen wir sagen, dass die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt trotz alledem sehr harmonisch und produktiv verlief.</description>

      <description>🤷‍♂️ What exactly does BEM stand for? BEM stands for Betriebliches Eingliederungsmanagement (company integration management). Since 2004, employers have been required by law to offer BEM to all employees who have been incapacitated for work for more than six weeks within a twelve-month period, regardless of the size of the company. The legal basis for this is the Ninth Book of the Social Code (§ 167 Par. 2 SGB IX).</description>

      <description>Wie vergleicht man Bilder in der App? Eines der wichtigsten Features unsere App ist das Vergleichen von ähnlichen Bildern, um besser entscheiden zu können, welche man behält und welche gelöscht werden können. Jedoch war die genaue Umsetzung dieses Features alles andere als einfach. Wir habe nach einer Möglichkeit gesucht, immer jeweils zwei Bilder direkt miteinander zu vergleichen und trotzdem jedes Bild möglichst groß anzeigen zu können.
Das Ergebnis ist, dass der Nutzer sich ein Hauptbild aus einem Set von ähnlichen Bildern aussuchen und die restlichen Bilder des Sets Schritt für Schritt mit diesem vergleichen kann.</description>

      <description>Initial Analysis After the initial registration, the user is asked about their previous exercise and eating habits. By analyzing this data, we assign users to a level of health awareness according to the &amp;ldquo;Stages of Change&amp;rdquo; model. From the data provided, e.g. the amount of fruit and vegetables eaten daily, and the calculated awareness level, we then calculate a percentage increase in the initial value, which forms the basis for the defined goals in the weekly challenge.</description>

Customize the Startpage Better Spotify changes that by replacing the Startpage with a widget system based on a grid layout. The widgets can be chosen by the user to give them the possibility of making the choice whether or not they want certain parts to be displayed.
Additionally, the widgets are moveable via drag-and-drop which makes it even easier for the user to customize the Homepage to their own needs and wishes.</description>

      <description>Zu Beginn des Projektes, hatten wir noch keine klare Idee von dem Thema Motorik und Konzentration und wie wir ein dazu passendes Spiel bauen könnten. Deshalb lag unser Fokus am Anfang stark auf der Recherche zu diesem Thema, bevor wir begonnen haben Spieleideen zu sammeln.
Recherche Wir hatten uns bereits früh darauf geeinigt, dass das Spiel auf Smartphones ausgerichtet sein soll. Aus diesem Grund haben wir uns explizit angesehen, was es bereits für Spiele auf diesen Geräten gibt, die in unsere Thematik passen könnten.</description>

      <description>Idea The idea for our app originated out of a conversation with a local gardening project. It is an approach to a rather recent question: How do you make spending time in nature more appealing to children and adolescents who grew up on smartphones and other mobile devices? Our supervisor, Prof. Dr. Lenz approached us with his initial idea for a mobile application which already laid out most of the core features that the final version of Strollr incorporates, like the ability to take photos and visualize walks with a map.</description>

      <description>Research Many questions were thrown into the pot upon our first meeting as a group. Since our game is based on graph theory, we needed to decide how we want to design it, what its general goals are and what programming languages and frameworks we want to use. Research and brainstorming was the order of the day. We dedicated our first weeks fully on the first, but very important decisions.</description>

      <description>Requirements Our project this semester “Berlin for Future” has been made together with the Senate of Berlin. The Senate has been looking for fresh and interesting ideas for making students more aware about climate change.
At our first meeting with the representative from the Senate we asked her about different aspects of the project (expectations, wishes, topic of interest). We found out about an idea of Klimasparbuch(climate savings book) for Berlin, a sustainable guide for the city, which has already been created for some regions in Germany.</description>

      <description>Design Evolution At the beginning, all ideas were collected on a Miroboard from which the following mock-ups were then developed (see image below). Players would land on a starting screen where they could select whether they wanted to start a new game or join an existing one. Two variants for the game-setup screen were mocked (screen 2 and 3). One would allow the host to manually select the players for a game, while the other alternative would randomly create teams based on all available, current app users.</description>

We had to do something with Unreal Engine 4, but the question was, what do we want to do? And how do we want to do it? Who wants to do what? In the beginning we had a lot of questions and we tried to hold all our ideas in a Miro board.</description>

      <description>Gathering Information First, the team needed to gather information about the internship administration process and the changes that had been made to it due to the COVID19-Pandemic. To do this we repeated the following three steps:
Talk to previous and current internship officers and the student assistants in the internship administration. Understand and visualize the process. Talk about the visualisations and make adjustments accordingly. What to keep? The next step was to evaluate the current IMI-Map and to decide what to keep and what to toss out.</description>

      <description>Our Agile Development Process Starting off Continuing our project allowed us to both reflect on what we had set out to make, what we had made so far, and what we thought would most effectively enhance our product in this second round of development. So far we had made a scene to work in as well as the tools and injuries that can occur from improper use.
The following two questions kicked off the start of this new project iteration:</description>

      <description>The Process Our journey began with our aspiration to create an art creating tool. Based on this idea, we planned out some milestones to achieve this goal. This, of course, should help us over time to plan and structure our project as well as possible. For this task we used agile methods which helped us to complete the project. We held our weekly meetings every Monday and on Tuesday mornings with our professor.</description>

      <description>Development Our starting point was an idea by our project supervisor, Mr. Till Leinen, and some wireframe designs he had already created to help us visualize his idea. The next step was to develop and implement a game plan. We began with regular Discord meetings to brainstorm ideas. We devised a rough development plan, and our user story mapping helped us in visualizing our MVP and future potential features for our application.</description>

The app&amp;rsquo;s goal is to provide a constantly learning and precautionary solution that allows rescue teams to react quickly and dynamically in case of emergencies while staying on top of things. Our team developed the prototype as a starting point for this ambitious endeavour.</description>

We worked under supervision of Alexander Haferland and Veronika Babic from the Berlin startup urban energy. Veronika also was our Product Manager, who approved or declined our ideas and suggestions and translated to us the urban energy&amp;rsquo;s vision of the project.</description>

      <description>Idea The initial idea for this project was brought to HTW by the Marc Sinan Company, that is currently working on a project creating different audio walks through Berlin in order to educate about its history of forced labour. The task was to build a mobile app, that would allow users to follow the audio tours and navigate them through the city and a content management system, to maintain the data from their side.</description>

      <description>First steps Our goal was clear. We generally knew what we had to do to reach our goal. Some questions still came up, that had to be answered first, before starting to code. We had to first decide on a framework we want to use. It was also important to know upfront whether our app is offline or online. After answering all these questions, we split up in two subgroups.</description>

      <description>How did we start The first step in our creation process was to identify the needs of Brandung and analyze the market. To our surprise we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any product that was focusing on meetings the same way we do. We began thinking about our own experiences with meetings or even classes and what kind of tool could have been useful to evaluate them. We came up with a bunch of fancy features but narrowed it down to a core functionality at the end for our MVP:</description>

While we did have the freedom to come up with any kind of VR game we wanted, we did stick with the idea of a fitness game. In one of our first meetings we tasked everyone to come up with at least one game concept. All ideas were written down in a shared Google Docs document.</description>

      <description>Design Thinking Process Ever since our team started working together, we have been integrating the method of Design Thinking - a non-linear, iterative process - to our project work. We went back and forth through its six stages to continuously improve our prototype. Design Thinking Process First Steps With a few ideas in mind we spent time researching to come up with potential technologies that best suit our goal and planned our next steps.</description>

      <description>In the past few months, our project has gone through various phases, and they could be roughly divided into the following segments:
Kicking off Preparation &amp;amp; Planning Database Structure &amp;amp; Website Blueprint Go Live! Booking System Prototyping Kicking off Fortunately, we decided to meet in person very early on and got to do it before the lock down, we went to the start-up company&amp;ndash;Cargobike Adventurer’s site at MotionLab Berlin, a coworking, or co-building, space for entrepreneurs and aspiring inventors.</description>

      <description>Project goals and approach Our approach towards developing The Mole can be explained with the help of Schell’s Elemental Tetrad [1]. This is a framework for game designers to support them in creating a certain desired gaming experience while keeping the purpose and the dependencies between the four pillars mechanics, aesthetics, story and technology of a game in mind.
To predefine the gaming experience, we followed the given project guideline to create a board game augmented by digital elements.</description>

      <description>The development process Throughout the duration of the project, we worked in a &amp;lsquo;Scrum-ban&amp;rsquo; mode. While we did plan our weekly sprints, we also worked very much on a &amp;lsquo;what-is-needed&amp;rsquo; basis. As we all had very different schedules, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have Dailies. Once a week we had a meeting that was Review and Sprint Planning in one. All code was located in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.</description>

      <description>Research Due to the lack of machine learning experience we started our project by researching how machine learning works, what different kinds of concepts exist and which of them are relevant for our path finding problem. Our project supervisors provided us with some useful starting points for this.
The main sources we built upon are GAN Path Finder, Pathfinding via Reinforcement and Imitation Multi-Agent Learning and Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</description>

      <description>Starting off We started this project without any prior experience in the field of occupational safety training and how such is taught. As the need was brought to us in the context of a larger research project, CoLearnET, we scheduled Zoom meetings with educational partners from AVT and bfw. They invited us to visit their workshops in order to gather enough information about the machines being used as well as the potential injuries.</description>

      <description>Development Our starting point was an already existing program which we wanted to improve. By both testing the program ourselves to understand and get into Vibro and analyzing the experts view, we evaluated the program to find common errors and see which features are more often used and essential for success. In the next step of our process we derived problems, prioritized them and discussed what we actually want to achieve.</description>

      <description>Brainstorming Idea StartRight wanted an application that would allow them to create contracts faster. After our first conversation and the resulting wishes, we worked out a concept together on how we could simplify the work processes of the student organization. We decided to develop not only the contract generator, but a whole application with additional features. Concept Before planning the concept, we researched existing tools that were similar to our idea.</description>

      <description>Idea The original idea for the allmende app came from David Müller, who was the supervisor for our project. He created the app for his master thesis with the goal to inspire people for nature through social-network-structures and gamification. Development After agreeing on recreating the App with React, we briefly familiarized ourselves with it. We devided us in pairs of two, to recreate the given features with react. It took us a great deal of time to rebuild the app and in the end we had to limitate the new features we wanted to implement in the first place.</description>

Our supervisors initial idea was to make the elective course registration for the IMI students easier, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways. This led us to a long period of time where we thought about different approaches and how realistic it is for us to achieve these.</description>

No matter if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a last minute Christmas present or just want to browse around. With the help of our supervisors Tino Nitze and Jakob Panten we were able to come up with the top feature of our app: the Live Feed - where you get new bargains live!

      <description>Idea A personality test has been a popular way of evaluating different characters for a very long time. Whether it’s in a professional business setting, for an academic study, or just for casual private uses. But usually, these tests are just long lists of abstract questions you have to answer with a scale of agree to disagree.
So that brings the question: what if there was another way we could determine a person’s personality other than using questionnaires?</description>

      <description>Because this project was just as much about looking for a solution for bringing real objects into the virtual space as it was about creating an interesting use case, we spent quite some time in the beginning researching possible solutions, before deciding on the hard- and software we would like to go with. Although we spent a substantial amount of time on evaluating the best approach, we still encountered an unexpected problem in the middle of the project, which forced us to stop working on the interactions and figure out another hardware solution.</description>

How is it diagnosed? Which are possible symptoms, which are most common and how are they treated? How frequent is Long Covid? What could be the cause of Long Covid? What do Long Covid patients wish for?

      <description>Long conceptual phase For about the first five weeks of our project, we were just doing conceptual work. We had to build an entire app without any precise specifications as to what functions it should perform. Therefore, we did many rounds in the first weeks to develop ideas, develop and discard concepts, and finally work out all the important details: What is the unique selling point of our app? What is our target audience?</description>

      <description>Choose Must Have Features As meeting the requirements of both students and lecturers often contracted each other we worked on a feature set that encapsulated a common ground between the two. Therefore we carefully selected a stable base feature set and axed features like a Moodle course list import, as we deemed that to be too confusing. Student Login System Another challenge was getting around the barrier of entry for students to fill out the questionnaires and participate in live feedback as well as evaluations.</description>

Before each sprint we did extensive sprint planning, guessing story points that reflect the complexity of each user story and defining what we want to get done within the sprint. If needed, we ended the sprint with a retrospective. Our process also included technical and functional reviews.</description>

      <description>Tech Stack Android &amp;amp; Kotlin Android is an open-source, Linux-based OS, mainly developed by Google. It&amp;rsquo;s well-documented and, next to iOS, the most common operating system for mobile devices. The team decided to develop an Android App, as some existing experience could be extended and most members were Android-device users.
Kotlin is a fairly modern programming language inspired by Java. It is clean, carries fewer formalities and is therefore shorter than Java.</description>

      <description>Our tech stack Tech Stack Django/Python When choosing the backend, we had decided to use Python in conjunction with Django. We had the choice to use NodeJS instead, but the final choice was Python in combination with Django. Django offers on the one hand the possibility to set up a SQLIte DB without downloading additional dependencies and on the other hand a fully integrated user-role management system. Furthermore, Django is an excellent tool to implement prototypical approaches.</description>

      <description>Our Tech Stack Used Technologies Regarding this point we mostly stayed true to last semester&amp;rsquo;s solutions.
Development The technological foundation we continued working on is realized with the Unity (2019.4.12f1) game engine, expanded by the SteamVR (1.2.3) and the Virtual Reality Toolkit (3.3.0) plugins. For project setup and code versioning we used the same approved GitLab self-hosted solution as last semester.
In terms of the targeted hardware: there were internal discussions at the beginning of the semester about porting the application to a standalone, inside-out-tracking based platform like the Oculus Quest 2.</description>

      <description>Tech Stack Overview Tech stack Frontend The frontend of our project consists of a mobile app and an editor. To save resources we decided to keep the used technologies of both of them as similar as possible. This way everyone was able to work at the app and the editor interchangeably.
Vue 3
Vue.js is a frontend framework for developing user interfaces. It uses declarative rendering and reactivity to update the DOM upon JavaScript state changes and has great TypeScript support.</description>

      <description>Our tech stack Tech Stack Flutter™️ The first step of the journey was choosing a framework that meets our requirements. We had very little experience with app development, so it was necessary to do some self-reliant research first and we ended up with two candidates: React Native and Flutter and we decided on the latter. The framework Flutter gained a lot of popularity among App-Developers in recent years. It allows us to develop our app cross-platform, so we receive a working Android APK as well as an iOS-Build with very few adjustments.</description>

      <description>These are the programming languages and other software products that our application, web service and 3D-pipeline is built on.
Client After detailed research, we decided to develop an Android™ application using the IDE Android Studio. Our decision to use the programming language Java over Kotlin, was based upon the fact that it is the main language that is taught in our studies.
All data that is generated while using the app is stored directly on the device in folders that were especially created for that.</description>

      <description>Throughout the whole project, we’ve used many tools alongside with our stack, and they can be organized into the following categories:
Figma &amp;amp; Miro Working on a real world project that has real users and product owners as stakeholders, preparation and planning are indispensable. We started out by using various templates from Miro, the perfect collaboration tool to conduct Product Vision, use cases, user stories, user personas researches. We then draw out our web page layouts, agreed on the color scheme and design elements that fit our product, and created a few UI drafts on the collaborative UI design tool Figma.</description>

      <description>Tech Stack React &amp;amp; Typescript For our Frontend we decided to use ReactJS with TypeScript. This gave us the advantage of having a well-documented library with a plethora of available resources. React is relatively easy to learn and it allowed us to have a modular structure where we could build various reusable components. To improve and ensure code-quality, we set up very strict linting and formatting rules. We used Bulma for essential styling.</description>

Our engine of choice, where all the little pieces come together
https://unity.com/ Oculus
We used the Oculus Rift S and the Oculus Quest with Oculus Link for a pc connection
https://www.oculus.com/ SteamVR
Allowed us to use different headsets without much hassle

      <description>Tech Stack NativeScript-Vue NativeScript is an open-souce framework to access native APIs in JavaScript. With the help of Android Studio and XCode it allows for building truly native applications with a JavaScript frontend framework, in this case Vue.js. During the development emulators have been used to preview the app.
TypeScript TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript and therefore makes it easier to understand and debug the code. It also transpiles to JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Einer der wesentlichen Gründe, warum wir uns schnell auf unser Spielekonzept einigen konnten, war, dass es sehr gut skalierbar ist. Während der Entwicklungsphase sind uns viele weitere Ideen und Elemente eingefallen, mit denen unser Konzept erweitert werden könnte.
So haben wir uns sehr viel mehr Distraktoren ausgedacht, als im fertigen Spiel enthalten sind zusätzlich hatten wir mit anderen Level-Konzepten und Spielmodi experimentiert.
Da wäre zum einen ein Free Play-Modus. Statt von uns erstellten Leveln, werden hier endlos Level mit einem zufälligen Pfad generiert.</description>

      <description>Frontend In the Frontend we had componets like the species selector which is a scrollable list of species. We wanted to create an accessible App with a modern user interface. To make the species selector accessible we used a hidden radio button in the background. We made sure that all our components to be accessible and semantically correct. Making all components accssible took us some time. In addition bringing the authentification to work was a more complex task then we first thought.</description>

      <description>❓ Understanding Concept and Construct Data Structure Model One important challenge was to understand and design an appropriate data model for all given conditions. The first wireframes were not fully finished, which is the reason some frames needed to be more clarified to continue the implementation. 🗣️ Close Cooperation and Communication Overall communication and close cooperation were significant parts of the project since exchanging information about features or general information about the application was crucial for the development process.</description>

If it runs stable and proves to be useful, there is potential for a more regular usage, maybe even in other institutions. However, Strollr would have to be deployed through official channels for a widespread release. This poses a financial issue, at least in the case of Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Store.</description>

      <description>What&amp;#39;s next? GeZuMi can be seen as a Proof of Concept. The goal was to determine whether distances could be reliably calculated and then further processed with Bluetooth technologies. Overall, there are technical limitations to the Bluetooth concept and it is not perfect for determining real time locations.
To reliably work with the transmitted data, the filtering of the RSSI values would have to become more precise so that the unexpected spikes and drops of the values could be balanced out.</description>

In order to achieve this, the test with the questions and their algorithm was the most important part. Our main forces were being used to ensure that the questions were easy to answer and had psychological value.
Going forward, the next steps would be to expand the database and create more jobs and relevant questions for them.</description>

We sincerely hope the long tradition of student projects and theses will continue and further generations of IMIs will continue maintaining and improving the IMI-Map.
And we already have a few ideas:

      <description>Thoughts The cutting edge we have been working on emcompases a number of exciting areas that offer room for expansion.
Gamification Our product (in its current form) makes use of gamification, which remains a debated topic. As with all serious games, the selection and implementation of gamification elements must be carefully made and tested. If done wrongly, such mechanics can be demotivating and, in our case, even harmful, if too much focus is shifted from the actual lessons of workshop safety to the completion of game goals.</description>

Further Implementations As Robert Storm Peterson said, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make predictions, but we&amp;rsquo;re going to try. What we do know is that there are still quite a few game ideas that we can work on in regards of Complex Zahlen. Since we only had one semester to develop the game, we focused on the parts that were most in demand and put the others on hold - at least for now.</description>

      <description>Many ideas, too little time Due to very limited time and lack of performance optimization, we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to include all features the Unreal Engine 5 has to offer. However, what we might to take a closer look on in the future and fully implement it into our showcase demo could be the following:
Full utilization of 3D Niagara Fluid Simulation

      <description>General The next step for our project is to contact more institutions who want to cooperate with us. We mainly want to focus on those who treat cultural, historical and social issues. The concept of the app will flourish when more data is added that users can discover.
Trigger warnings As some of the topics present in this app include sensitive content, we want to add the possibility to flag content with trigger warnings, to make sure that everybody can enjoy this app.</description>

      <description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? While things like improving the text recognition or speeding up the scanning are ongoing processes, we still have some ideas for new features that will improve the app. One thing that is on our bucket list, is to contact the European Commission because they have shown interest in projects that use their data. The European Commission has other datasets that are related to the CosIng dataset that we use, so we want to expand our dataset and implement relations between these datasets.</description>

But, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to see if the received feedback has led to an overall improvement of the meeting quality?

      <description>Future Features Due to the way our Game is built and envisioned, it was quite easy for us to come up with more potential features, than we could actually implement into the game, with the given time, budget and/or skill. Most of the ideas were about adding more variety to the features that were already implemented in the game, such as creating more maps:
For example:
having the player float on a galleon on top of an ocean, with the enemies closing in on ghost ships a Sci-Fi city map with flying cars, robots etc.</description>

More control over matches More matching criterias and filters for the search: To make sure our algorithm works great for personal values, we decided to postpone the implementation of search criterias such as ‘location’ and ‘salary’. We are eager to add them as soon as possible.</description>

One of the most important next steps, now that we achieved that goal, is to make sure the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are followed. While some features of the game offer great opportunities, e.g. the logged history of each game for which we could add an voice over for the visually impared, for others we will need the option to disable them if needed.</description>

With more time and hyperparameter adjustments the quality of the path predictions could be improved. More Concepts As part of our project we also came up with more concepts which have not yet been implemented.
The first is “step by step walking from both directions”. The concept is similar to our current reinforcement learning approach, but it allows parallelisation.</description>

      <description>Our Future Plans Our team is proud of the progress achieved during this semester. We see it as a good foundation for future development.
Furthermore during our user tests we were able to verify what we already assumed: there is a strong request for VR applications to enrich current safety training lessons. User testing was also especially helpful to gather valuable feedback, which we used to generate even more ideas for improvement.</description>

      <description>Extensions Our task was to make the elective course registration for IMI bachelor students easier. However, our final product can easily be extended, which will probably be done in a bachelor thesis.
All HTW students Since the studyplan can only help IMI bachelor students with their elective course registration and organization so far, the next step would be to make it usable for master students and someday all the other students as well.</description>

      <description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? For now we would like to keep working on this project privately and keep improving it! We have come far but there is still a lot that we would like to do.. Additional Features Social Media Hub There are some new features we would like to add in the future such as adding notifications for limited time offers and being able to choose between main and sub categories in browser.</description>

      <description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? Creating a whole game in such a short time span was no easy task. Basing that game on psychological research even less so. We are very excited to publish a fleshed out game, even if we had to cut some of the planned features short.
There are many ideas we could still expand on. But whether some of us might return to this game, or if we&amp;rsquo;ll all start new projects utilising the experience we gathered during this one, remains to be seen.</description>

      <description>Beyond the MVP To make patients of Long Covid feel even less alone, our app should also provide
a possibility for them to connect with others in the same situation to exchange experiences a way to document experiences in their own words, like a blog, that they can share with others who are not affected Inputting a vaccination certificate or PCR test result via QR code directly into the app could help to avoid errors and make the app even easier to use.</description>

      <description>Standalone VR Even though the Oculus Quest theoretically could offer hand tracking and a controller at the same time, they currently do not support this via their framework. This forced us to use the Leap Motion for hand tracking which is furthermore tying us to desktop VR. We hope they will open up this functionality in the future, because it would be more portable as a Quest app. Adding more Right now we only use three API’s and four different visualization types, it would be very easy to add more data sources and other ways to visualize the data on the globe.</description>

      <description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? We want to make the App easy to use and adjustable. Our plan is to make an all in one app, so that Artists can use it for their own shows, adjust it to their needs and can help to improve it via open source and modding options. Additional Features Our project has many opportunities for new features. We want to make it more variable so that you can use it for different shows, change visualization presets in the app or activate effects on runtime.</description>

      <description>Whatever you need, whenever you need it We made a huge progress in defining our final product vision when we asked ourselves what the specific use cases for our product were. We wanted to provide a tool that gives you the freedom to do what you need to do at the specific moment to make your group-project work, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t overwhelm you with fancy features that you most likely won&amp;rsquo;t make any use of.</description>

      <description>Tech Stack Amazon AWS During the early stages of our project we agreed that we want to run the application as cost-efficient, scalable and performant as possible. We therefore decided to build the system on a serverless architecture using Amazon AWS Lambda functions. The lambda functions only run when they are called through their individual endpoints and provide the latest prediction data generated by the machine learning model. At the end of each month we only have to pay for the computing powert that way required to run these functions.</description>

To give a short idea of what had been planned by the team but discarded due to the time restrictions, only a selected few of the 30+ ideas in the backlog will be explained. Comment function One improvement that the focus group had talked about and one of our team members had found during research was the possibility of leaving a comment on a song.</description>

      <description>Where we&amp;#39;re at? During the last few months we were able to create a full design library with custom components that allows future designers to enter the project and quickly start designing new components. This was accomplished by keeping the entire figma document clearly and well structured. We were also able to deliver a high-fidelity prototype dashboard that already covers a full basic user flow within a framework that easily allows future developers to add more functionality without compromising for scalability or performance.</description>

      <description>The Team We are a team of 8 people in total. This semester, we decided to develop a playable Unreal Engine 5 showcase demo. Each of us had different prior knowledge of the Unreal Engine at the beginning of the project. In the past 4 months we have done our best to demonstrate the new features of the Unreal Engine 5 in a short playable demo. In the process we also encountered various challenges, be it the hardware-hungry Unreal Engine 5, unstable performance or the lack of sufficient repository space.</description>

Together with Socket.io, which enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication, we had the perfect base for building our application. MongoDB We decided to work with MongoDb, which is a document-oriented database system, classified as a NoSQL database program. It is really simple to use, but offers deep query-abilities at the same time.</description>

      <description>Architecture architecture The architecture is seperated into three layers: Machine Learning Mircoservice, Backend and Frontend. The Machine Learning Mircoservice get requests from the Backend with an image that should be classified. Inside the Machine Learning Mircoservie a Flask instance is running to handle requests from the Backend. When a image should be classified the TensorFlow Model uses our trained models to classify the image and sends a response with information about which animal could be classified.</description>

      <description>Chat Implementation Allmende is a social media platform for nature enthusiast. A missing but a mandatory function for a social media app is the ability to chat with other nature enthusiast. Having this feature enables the user the opportunity to communicate in real-time and to connect with others. Edit User Profil For a social media platform it is very important to create a user profil. It would be good to be able to change the profil image.</description>

      <description>👥 Support Groups For greater support and help, support groups should be integrated in the application. These groups can help users to connect with a number of like-minded users which will make it easier to deal with complicated topics and share similar experiences. Additionally, users who are not BEM entitled or buddies can join these support groups anytime. 🗺️ Map A map shall help users to find buddies near their locations.</description>

      <description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? If we have had more time, we probably would have come up with so much more ideas of what to integrate in The Missing Tool. And we already had some ideas that we would like to be realized in the future – either by us or some other students who will get a chance to work on the tool. Audiochat We want to give our users the opportunity to chat via audio, as an addition to the chat that is already present.</description>

      <description>Die Entwicklung des Design der App ist einer der faszinierendsten Prozesse des gesamten Projekts. Es zeigt einem, wie gut man Farben kombinieren kann, wie man unterschiedlichen Formen fühlt, wie man Objekte auf der Seite zusammenstellen kann usw. Dies ist ein kreativer Prozess, an dem jeder teilnehmen kann, unabhängig davon, welches Wissen er besitzt. Er verbindet und gibt viel zum Nachdenken.
Bei der Entwicklung unseres ersten Designs waren wir kaum beschränkt, sodass wir unserer Kreativität freien Lauf lassen konnten.</description>

      <description>🧊 bloc integration We&amp;rsquo;re planning to expand our Flutter application by integrating Bloc for state management. Bloc will provide us with a more structured approach to handle state, making our codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. 🤖 future models As of now, the only currently available models for fine-tuning from OpenAI will be deprecated and no longer accessible in the near future. Instead, new models like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 will be made available for fine-tuning in the upcoming months.</description>

      <description>Flutter/Dart Das Projekt war das Ergebnis eines Hackathons. Es wurde ursprünglich in Flutter (Dart) geschrieben, also mussten wir nicht die Programmiersprache auswählen, in der wir unsere App schreiben würden, als wir anfingen, daran zu arbeiten. Flutter ist eine sehr einfaches, klares und angenehmes Open-Source UI-Entwicklungs-Kit von Google, die für jeden Anfänger, der sich für die Entwicklung von Cross-Plattform-Apps interessiert, verständlich ist. Alle Komponenten in Flutter sind widgets, aus denen wir unsere App Stück für Stück zusammenstellen.</description>
