      <description>Process We started the project with a brainstorming phase to come up with realistic use cases, which can be done in the given time and with regard of our skills. There were multiple different ideas like a chat assistant and including the OpenAI speech recognition Whisper. Finally we decided on 3 use cases to explore: curated shopping list, product comparison and a product summary.
The first week was focused on onboarding, reading OpenAI documentation and prompt engineering to test feasability of our selected use cases.</description>
