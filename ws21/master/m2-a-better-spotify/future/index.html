            Overview
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        As Better Spotify is an application that was created solely to provide an improved version of an already existing streaming platform, the <strong>possible extensions</strong> to it are truly endless. To give a short idea of what had been planned by the team but discarded due to the time restrictions, only a selected few of the <strong>30+ ideas</strong> in the backlog will be explained.
    </div>

<section>
    <h3>
        
            Comment function
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>One improvement that the focus group had talked about and one of our team members had found during research was the possibility of <strong>leaving a comment</strong> on a song. Said comment could either be visible for everyone or just friends. It would be helpful to share songs and directly leave a review underneath them for others to see.</p>
<p>Having the comments be visible for <strong>friends only</strong> would prevent public negativity on songs and merely be a way for friends connected over the streaming platform to communicate and share their opinions.</p>
<p>It would also be a nice way to leave notes for oneself directly in the app which could be used for multiple purposes such as <strong>reminders</strong>, <strong>looking back at songs</strong>, figuring out how they affected oneself, whether or not they work with others and much more. Having a comment function, in general, could be a nice addition to the streaming platform.</p>

    <h3>
        
            Song catcher
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Most people interested in music and listening to it, find new songs while they’re out and about should know about the application Shazam which is a <strong>Song catcher</strong>, scanning music coming in through a mobile device’s microphone and then finding the appropriate song for it on the internet.</p>
<p>Even though Shazam is already connected to Spotify when the song is available on the platform, a song catcher built into Better Spotify, which doesn’t just take the song itself but a <strong>sung / hummed</strong> version of it when one is trying to remember both music / lyrics themselves would be extremely handy to have.</p>
<p>It would improve the way to find music in the app itself a lot even though the <strong>AI</strong> behind the song recognition would have to be trained very specifically for the directly sung / hummed version of songs.</p>

    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>
        
            Personal Usage Statistics
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Something so incredibly banal but nice to have would be a view of the personal usage of the app. Spotify already started doing it with their Spotify Rewinds at the end of every year and yet the app <strong>fails</strong> to <em>provide proper views and numbers</em> for the user to be constantly available.</p>
<p>Tracking one’s listening history over time, the amount of <strong>time spent on the app</strong>, which <strong>genre’s</strong> are the user’s current favourite, <strong>how many playlists</strong> have been listened to how many times, which <strong>songs</strong> in them are <strong>skipped over</strong> a lot while others have been listened to on repeat. Statistics like those aren’t just interesting for the app itself but especially for the user to see. A positive example already presenting this form of feature would be Audible.</p>
<p>They could be used to <strong>self-analyse</strong>, <strong>adjust listening behaviour</strong> or even just to chat with friends and compare different <strong>statistical points</strong>.</p>

    </div>

<section>
    <h3>
        
            Shortcuts
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Shortcuts nowadays are something that we could not imagine living without it. Having Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, the F5 button to reload and so many more are doing nothing but make our lives easier.
Having the possibility of adding shortcuts like these to Better Spotify</p>
<ul>
<li>playing the chosen song</li>
<li>making new playlists</li>
<li>stopping</li>
<li>muting</li>
<li>shuffling</li>
<li>switching tabs within the application</li>
</ul>
<p>So far there are only extensions to browsers that make it possible for the user to have keyboard shortcuts which is definitely a missed opportunity when it comes to the <strong>usability</strong> of the app. Especially thinking about people not being able to click precisely with a mouse would have it much easier pressing one or two buttons to achieve the same thing. <strong>Inclusivity</strong> is something that definitely needs to be a part of a web applications design.</p>
