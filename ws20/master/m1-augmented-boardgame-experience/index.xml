      <description>Project goals and approach Our approach towards developing The Mole can be explained with the help of Schellâ€™s Elemental Tetrad [1]. This is a framework for game designers to support them in creating a certain desired gaming experience while keeping the purpose and the dependencies between the four pillars mechanics, aesthetics, story and technology of a game in mind.
To predefine the gaming experience, we followed the given project guideline to create a board game augmented by digital elements.</description>

      <description>Technologies In the following, all important technologies used in our project are indicated. For each technology, the logo, name and general function are presented. This should help you to better understand the graphic of the software architecture in the next paragraph. Architecture The following graphic describes the software architecture of the game &amp;ldquo;The Mole&amp;rdquo;.
There are two basic elements in the architecture, a backend server and a frontend server. Both our servers are deployed on the cloud application platform heroku.</description>

      <description>Accessibility Due to the time constraints of this project, our first and foremost goal was to create a working prototype to present at the end of the semester.
One of the most important next steps, now that we achieved that goal, is to make sure the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are followed. While some features of the game offer great opportunities, e.g. the logged history of each game for which we could add an voice over for the visually impared, for others we will need the option to disable them if needed.</description>
