            The development process
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Throughout the duration of the project, we worked in a &lsquo;Scrum-ban&rsquo; mode. While we did plan our weekly sprints, we also worked very much on a &lsquo;what-is-needed&rsquo; basis. As we all had very different schedules, we didn&rsquo;t have Dailies. Once a week we had a meeting that was Review and Sprint Planning in one. All code was located in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.</p>
<p>In order to work on a ticket, the person who wanted to work on it claimed it, created a branch off of develop based on our naming conventions and, whenever they thought it was done, created a merge request.
In the beginning of our development, we often ran into problems with actually getting the merge requests reviewed and approved. To counteract that, we agreed upon a process, where we&rsquo;d notify the rest of the team in our chat, as emails sent by Gitlab were often ignored.</p>

            Code-review is important!
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        All new code had to be reviewed before being merged into the develop branch. We never merged our code before a given merge request was approved by a a person who had not developed the feature. When merge requests became too large, the person who implemented it would sit down with a reviewer and walk them through it, adapting the code where it was needed.

            Corona and Remote Work
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        Due to Corona, our semester and team work were also conducted fully remotely. We had weekly team meetings and often substituted those by having multiple calls during the week /  Sprint. While some of the decisions might have been taken more quickly in an onsite setting, we found that pair-programming remotely worked well with the tools we had chosen.

            Difficulties we encountered
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        Our team had very varying skill-sets, which in some cases led to one or two members feeling stranded and left alone. This could&rsquo;ve have been more easily avoided in a normal project setting, but due to the remote context, we didn&rsquo;t always notice it right away.
