      <description>Brainstorming This project was initially pitched to us as a VR audio fitness game for the Oculus Quest. While we did have the freedom to come up with any kind of VR game we wanted, we did stick with the idea of a fitness game. In one of our first meetings we tasked everyone to come up with at least one game concept. All ideas were written down in a shared Google Docs document.</description>

      <description>Our tech stack Unity &amp;amp; Oculus VR The Project was presented as an Oculus Quest VR Game in Unity from the very beginning - and we were quite happy with these tools. While some of us already had some experience in Unity, we still took our time to get to know the engine properly. Oculus offers an Integration Package for Unity, which helped us to get started with VR development.</description>

      <description>Future Features Due to the way our Game is built and envisioned, it was quite easy for us to come up with more potential features, than we could actually implement into the game, with the given time, budget and/or skill. Most of the ideas were about adding more variety to the features that were already implemented in the game, such as creating more maps:
For example:
having the player float on a galleon on top of an ocean, with the enemies closing in on ghost ships a Sci-Fi city map with flying cars, robots etc.</description>
