        Our <strong>goal was clear</strong>. We generally knew what we had to do to reach our goal.
Some <strong>questions</strong> still <strong>came up</strong>, that had to be answered first, before starting to code.
We had to first <strong>decide on a framework</strong> we want to use.
It was also important to know upfront whether our app is <strong>offline or online</strong>.
After answering all these questions, we <strong>split up in two subgroups</strong>. One group was <strong>responsible for the backend</strong> and how we would <strong>retrieve the data</strong>.
The other group was <strong>responsible for the frontend</strong> and how we <strong>integrate the text recognition plugin</strong>.
We were <strong>always staying in contact</strong> and <strong>communicating with each other regularly</strong>.
We <strong>stayed</strong> in these <strong>subgroups</strong> up until our <strong>prototype was done</strong>.

        We knew a couple of things before thinking of our design. Our app would have three pages: A <strong>search, camera and history screen</strong>. We also liked the idea of <strong>valuing a clean and simple design over a complex one</strong> because it fits our app the best.

        For our <strong>prototype</strong>, we wanted to make sure that our <strong>basic structure</strong> and <strong>feature set</strong> is <strong>present</strong>. Our <strong>UI</strong> wasn&rsquo;t the <strong>main focus at that point</strong>. After having our prototype, we also set out to <strong>improve our UI</strong> by making it <strong>look more like our Mockup</strong>.

            Second phase
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        Our second phase started with a <strong>brainstorm</strong>.
We thought about <strong>possible features</strong> and <strong>sorted them by their priority</strong>.
This process took some time because we came up with great ideas but filtering them to what was possible in our given time window wasn&rsquo;t easy.<br>
The <strong>Miro board helped us</strong> a lot in the process of visualising and managing our ideas.
We also used it as a Task/Kanban board.
We <strong>never ran out of ideas</strong>, therefore our idea collection and <strong>prioritisation changed weekly</strong>.
Staying in touch with our <strong>supervisor helped us</strong> a good deal with our decision making over which features to implement.
Keeping a <strong>constant communication flow allowed</strong> us to be <strong>very flexible</strong>.
This phase lasted until the end of our development.

            Obstacles

    <div class="content">
        <h4 id="group-responsible-for-our-data-retrieval">Group responsible for our data retrieval</h4>
<p>Our backend group struggled with retrieving data at first.
Since our <strong>data came from the European Commission</strong>, who was <strong>fond of helping people</strong> who were going to use the data, we knew that we wanted to <strong>get in touch</strong> with them to see if they had an <strong>API endpoint</strong> or something else to help us in any way.
It turns out they had one, but it was <strong>poorly documented</strong>.
We <strong>didn&rsquo;t know</strong> how to <strong>access the data</strong> we wanted.
After a lot of <strong>confusion</strong> and a couple of <strong>mails exchanging</strong>, we found out that the endpoint <strong>didn&rsquo;t even provide a way to access the data</strong> but only to return a file containing the data.
So it was a <strong>dead-end</strong> and cost us at least 1 1/2 weeks.</p>
<h4 id="group-responsible-for-our-text-recognition">Group responsible for our text recognition</h4>
<p>At around the same time, the other group struggled with their own problems.
One of their tasks was to <strong>cut unnecessary words from our recognized text</strong>, so we didn&rsquo;t have to search for them in our database hence improving our performance.
Their <strong>idea</strong> was to use <strong>RegEx</strong> but <strong>no one</strong> in our group <strong>has used</strong> RegEx before.
It was quite a <strong>drag</strong> for them to get into RegEx, especially because we had so many <strong>little details to consider</strong>.
This was an <strong>ongoing process</strong> up until the end because there was always <strong>something to improve on</strong>.</p>
